### NU HLT at CMCL 2022 Shared Task: Multilingual and Crosslingual Prediction of Human Reading Behavior in Universal Language Space

This repository contains the singly Python notebook for extracting features for eye-tracking prediction such as frequencies, n-grams, information theoretic, and psycholinguistically-motivated predictors. From the title, it is worth noting that these feature values were extracted from the coverted IPA form of the words.

## Requirements

 1. [Epitran](https://github.com/dmort27/epitran) for converting words to IPA form. Can be done for English, German, Hindi, Dutch, Russian, and Mandarin. 
 2. Imageability and concreteness estimates from word embedding from the work of [Ljubešić et al, 2018](https://aclanthology.org/people/n/nikola-ljubesic/). Download the files [here](https://github.com/clarinsi/megahr-crossling).
 3. If you want to reproduce the results for the crosslingual task, you need phonetic transcriptions of the surprise language (Danish) data. You may subscribe to [this](http://tom.brondsted.dk/text2phoneme/) paid service or.... you may contact me for the file :wink:.


Please refer to the official Shared Task website for more information and to get the train/valid/test dataset: https://cmclorg.github.io/shared_task
